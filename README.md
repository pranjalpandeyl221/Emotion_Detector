# Emotion Detector

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building an **Emotion Detection System** using machine learning techniques. The system classifies human emotions based on input data, such as text, images, or other modalities.

## Features
- Preprocessing and feature extraction from the dataset.
- Implementation of a machine learning or deep learning model for emotion classification.
- Model evaluation with performance metrics.
- Visualization of results for better interpretability.
